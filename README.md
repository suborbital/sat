# Sat, the tiny WebAssembly edge compute server

> Sat (as in satellite) is an experiment, and isn't ready for production use. Please try it out and give feedback!

Sat is a WebAssembly-powered server designed to have the maximum performance and smallest possible footprint. Our [Atmo](https://github.com/suborbital/atmo) project is a fully-fledged platform with support for running entire applications, whereas Sat takes the opposite approach: run a single Wasm module really f***ing fast.

Sat has no dependencies (it's statically compiled), and can run in a tiny Docker container (Distroless) or on bare metal. It's meant to live in small places such as edge compute environments.

### Using Sat

To run Sat, Docker is easiest:

```bash
docker run -it -e SAT_HTTP_PORT=8080 -p 8080:8080 suborbital/sat:latest sat https://github.com/suborbital/reactr/blob/main/rwasm/testdata/hello-echo/hello-echo.wasm\?raw\=true
```

Sat will start up, download the `hello-echo` module from the `examples` directory, and make it available on port 8080. You can then make a POST request to `localhost:8080`, and the body will be echoed back to you.

```bash
curl localhost:8080 -d 'my friend'
```

Sat executes modules with the [Runnable API](https://atmo.suborbital.dev/runnable-api/introduction) enabled, so you can create modules using our [Subo CLI](https://github.com/suborbital/subo) and all of the capabilities are available for use.

### Building Sat

If you'd like to build Sat yourself, clone this repo and run:

```bash
# On M1, you may need to run `export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0`
make docker run
```

This will build the `suborbital/sat:dev` Docker image and then launch it using the same `hello-echo` module.

### Stdin mode

As an alternative to running Sat as a server, you can also use it in `stdin` mode. First, build Sat:

```bash
make sat
```

Then, run Sat with an input on stdin:

```bash
echo "world" | .bin/sat --stdin ./examples/hello-echo/hello-echo.wasm
```

Sat will write the response to stdout and exit.

### Run from URL

If you provide a URL as the path argument to Sat, it will download the module from that URL, write it to a temp directory, and use it for execution:

```bash
.bin/sat "https://github.com/suborbital/reactr/blob/main/rwasm/testdata/hello-echo/hello-echo.wasm?raw=true"
```

The URL must be HTTPS and must have a `.wasm` suffix (excluding query parameters)

### Statically compiling

The `make sat` target creates a dynamically linked binary. To create a statically linked version, run:

```bash
make sat/static
```

Static linking is not available on Mac.

### Constellations

Sat is designed to run in a constellation, i.e. a meshed cluster of instances. This enables very interesting network topologies which can run applications in massively distributed and 'edge' environments. This repo includes the `constd` tool, which is an experiment-atop-experiment constellation manager that can run [Atmo](https://github.com/suborbital/atmo) applications in a distributed manner using a Sat constellation. You can learn more [here](./constd).
